Welcome to the **Prosopography of U.S. Mayors** project.  
This project uses a prosopographical approach to analyze the collective biographies of mayors across American cities. By combining socio-demographic, political, and educational data, it aims to highlight shared trajectories, institutional affiliations, and their evolution over time.

## Project Workflow

The project followed a simple, structured workflow:

1. **Define the research problem**  
   - Formulate guiding research questions inspired by prosopography.  

2. **Identify and collect data**  
   - Retrieve biographical, political, and educational information.  
   - Use **SPARQL queries** to extract structured data from Wikidata.  

3. **Clean and prepare datasets**  
   - Harmonize variables (gender, parties, universities, time periods).  
   - Create derived fields (age groups, Ivy League classification, periods).  

4. **Conduct exploratory analysis**  
   - Descriptive statistics on gender, party, and age.  
   - Bivariate tests (Chi², Cramer’s V) to assess associations.  

5. **Perform temporal analysis**  
   - Track representation and dominance across historical periods.  

6. **Explore educational backgrounds**  
   - Identify most influential universities.  
   - Build network representations linking mayors and institutions.  

7. **Synthesize findings**  
   - Relate demographic, political, and educational structures.  
   - Highlight their evolution and interconnections over time.
