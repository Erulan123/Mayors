## Research Problem

In an exploratory approach, this project aims to propose a simplified model of the political field of United States mayors, understood as a prosopographical study of individuals who have held mayoral positions in American cities. The goal is to represent the structure of social, political, and educational backgrounds of these actors, as well as their affiliations with organizations (notably political parties and universities), and the resulting networks of relationships. We also seek to model how this structure has evolved over time. 

In line with a prosopographical method, we will systematically collect biographical and socio-demographic characteristics of mayors in order to highlight shared career patterns, educational backgrounds, and political trajectories.

## Research Questions

1. How has the gender distribution of mayors in the United States evolved over time (by decade)?
2. What is the typical age at which individuals first become mayor, and has this age changed across generations?
3. Which universities are most frequently attended by mayors, and how has their influence evolved over time?
4. Are Ivy League graduates overrepresented among US mayors compared to other institutions?
5. What is the distribution of political party affiliations among US mayors, and how has this changed over time?
6. Is there a statistical association between political party affiliation and gender among mayors? (Chi-square test)
7. Is there a statistical association between political party affiliation and educational background? (Chi-square test)
8. What prior occupations are most common among mayors (e.g., lawyers, businesspeople, educators)?
9. What networks can be observed between mayors and the universities they attended? Which institutions appear most central?
10. What networks can be observed between mayors and political parties? Which parties are most central over time?
