# U.S. Mayors

This project explores the political field of United States mayors through a **prosopographical approach** â€” the collective study of individuals and their trajectories. By systematically collecting socio-demographic, political, and educational information, we aim to represent:

- The **social, political, and educational backgrounds** of mayors.
- Their **affiliations** with political parties and universities.
- The **networks** emerging from these affiliations.
- The **evolution** of these structures over time.

The project combines statistical analysis, temporal exploration, and network modeling to better understand how gender, party affiliation, education, and age have shaped mayoral careers across U.S. history.
