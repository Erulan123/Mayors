## Research Problem

In an exploratory approach, this project aims to propose a simplified model of the political field of United States mayors, understood as a prosopographical study of individuals who have held mayoral positions in American cities. The goal is to represent the structure of social, political, and educational backgrounds of these actors, as well as their affiliations with organizations (notably political parties and universities), and the resulting networks of relationships. We also seek to model how this structure has evolved over time.

In line with a prosopographical method, we will systematically collect biographical and socio-demographic characteristics of mayors in order to highlight shared educational backgrounds and political trajectories.

## Research Questions

- How has the **gender representation** of mayors evolved across different historical periods?  
- What trends can be observed in **political party dominance** over time?  
- What is the **typical ages** at which individuals first become mayor, and has this age changed across generations?
- Is there an association between a mayorâ€™s **gender** and their **political affiliation**?  
- Does the **age distribution** of mayors differ across political parties?  
- To what extent are **gender and age group** independent among mayors?
- Which **universities** have been most influential in producing mayors?
- What networks can be observed between mayors and the universities they attended? Which institutions appear most central?

## Aspects of Information to Collect

* Birth dates (to calculate age at first term)
* Gender
* Political party affiliation
* Educational background (universities, degrees, Ivy League classification)
* Office start and end dates (terms in office, to enable temporal analysis)
* Position items (Mayor of New York City, Mayor of Chicago, etc.)
* Networks linking mayors to universities
